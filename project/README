PROJECT CONFIGURATION
------------------------
You must do the following before you launch the project on Kathara:

1. Replace 11 in the ASN file to your own AS number, e.g., 100 if your are AS100.
2. Edit device and link configuration for your AS at the end of the lab.conf file.
3. Change BGP peering of AS1 and AS21 from AS11 to your ASN in the files below:
   - as1r1/etc/quagga/bgpd.conf 
   - as21r1/etc/quagga/bgpd.conf
4. Add configuration folders and startup scripts for your devices
   - For example, r1 should be: asXr1 and asXr1.startup where X is your ASN
   - Similarly, asXs1, asXc1 for s1 and c1, respectively.

START KATHARA
------------------------
Kathara launches one terminal per device when it starts.
With our project configuration, you will see many terminals, which can be overwhelming.
To avoid this, you may start kathara without any terminal and connect to each device manually. In this way, you don't have to deal with terminals belonging to other ASes.
To start kathara without terminal, run:
  kathara lstart --noterminals

DHCP CLIENT CAVEAT
------------------------
DHCP client cannot update /etc/resolv.conf.
Nevertheless, it should create a tentative file with a similar name below:
  /etc/resolv.conf.dhclient-new.XX
where XX is number that changes over time
You will have to copy it manually with a command:
  cp /etc/resolv.conf.dhclient-new.XX /etc/resolv.conf
You need to do this, otherwise DNS will not work correctly.
